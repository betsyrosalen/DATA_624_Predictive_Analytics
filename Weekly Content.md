Here is the approach Hyndman took.

## Week 7 (Week of March 10)

### Instructions for the week

This week we begin looking at ARIMA.  I am allowing two weeks for this module as the content is pretty thick and you also need some time for your project as well.  Please begin by reading chapter 8 in Hyndman.  This week the group working on ARIMA should be ready to present.  Homework 6 is not due until next week but can be found in next week's content.  Hint  - I would start working on it.

## Week 8 (Week of March 17)

### Instructions for the week

This week we continue our focus on ARIMA. Please finishing reading chapter 8 in Hyndman and complete Homework 6 by Sunday night.  Keep plugging away at the project as well.

### Homework 6

Do the exercises 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.5., 8.6, 8.7 in Hyndman.  Please submit both the Rpubs link as well as your .rmd file.

## Week 9 (Week of March 24)

### Instructions for the week

This week allows you to focus on the project.  Remember it is due Sunday night.  Please see the instructions in the projects folder.  Any overachievers that are done with the project feel free to read Kuhn and Johnson chapter 6.

## Week 10 (Week of March 31)

### Instructions for the week

This week we turn our attention away from time series to building predictive models.  Our first area of focus is a deeper look at linear regression.  I know this was covered in Data 621 but a deep understanding is vital for the weeks to come.  Please read chapter 6 in the Kuhn and Johnson book and homework 7 is due Sunday night.  We will be hearing from the group assigned to linear regression and its cousins, and the next group focused on presenting non-linear regression should start preparing.  

### Homework 7

In Kuhn and Johnson do problems 6.2 and 6.3. There are only two but they consist of many parts.  Please submit a link to your Rpubs and submit the .rmd file as well.

## Week 11 (Week of April 7)

### Instructions for the week

This week we turn to focus on non-linear regression including neural networks, MARS, SVM and KNN.  The group presenting on this be ready at the meet up and the next group should start working on Trees and Rules-Based Models.  Please read chapter 7 in Kuhn and Johnson and allow enough time to understand it.  Homework 8 is due Sunday night.

### Homework 8

Do problems 7.2 and 7.5 in Kuhn and Johnson. There are only two but they have many parts. Please submit both a link to your Rpubs and the .rmd file.

## Week 12 (Week of April 21)

### Instructions for the week

We are now moving to the concepts of trees and rules-based models.  With the break coming I will give you to the end of it to submit.  Please read chapter 8 in Kuhn and Johnson and homework 9 will be due on April 28.  Also the team presenting on Trees and Rule-based will be up this next meet up.  I will open up project 2 as well due at the end of the semester but I would get started on it. It is a group project that you will work with your same group as your presentation.  The project is in the projects folder.

### Homework 9

Do problems 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, and 8.7 in Kuhn and Johnson.  Please submit the Rpubs link along with the .rmd file.

## Week 13 (Week of April 28)

### Instructions for the week

The purpose of this section is to give you an overview of various recommender systems approaches to data science.  These are approaches that look for similarity or rules between data points.  Two common methods are rules association (market basket analysis) and clustering. Great R packages to look at include arules, arulesviz and hclust.   I have attached several articles for you to read and there is a homework set as well which is due on Sunday.  Please keep working on your second project.

### Market Basket Article 1

Imagine 10000 receipts sitting on your table. Each receipt represents a transaction with items that were purchased. The receipt is a representation of stuff that went into a customer’s basket - and therefore ‘Market Basket Analysis’.

That is exactly what the Groceries Data Set contains: a collection of receipts with each line representing 1 receipt and the items purchased. Each line is called a transaction and each column in a row represents an item.  The data set is attached.

Your assignment is to use R to mine the data for association rules. You should report support, confidence and lift and your top 10 rules by lift. 

Extra credit: do a simple cluster analysis on the data as well.  Use whichever packages you like.  Due May 3 before midnight.



## Week 14 (Week of May 5)

### Instructions for the week

This is our final week together. I hope you have enjoyed the class.  Remember your final project is due Sunday May 12 before midnight.   One final thing  - I would like you to assess yourself on participation in the slack channel. Please submit a brief text summary here in blackboard describing how you participated in the classroom forums/discussions on slack.

### Participation Self-Assessment

Please briefly assess and describe your participation in the class forums/discussions on slack.  Grade will reflect both your actual participation as well as your self-assessment.
